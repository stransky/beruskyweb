If you think there's a felicitation ahead,
praising your genius, you're rather wrong.

The thing is you haven't really made anything
so far. "Training" becomes doable for a smarter
beast after some time, too, which makes us think
that a felicitation wouln't be appropriate.
Some of you could take it as an irony or even
an insult or ridicule.

Think, we appreciate you, players, and we
wouln't like to offend you by an inappropriate
felicitation in the beginning.

When we can't congratulate you we should at
least praise you, but there's nothing to
be praised for.

You surely took lots of useless steps while
playing, you repeated the last level at least
once, you were often looking into the help...

We should actually rebuke you. Yes, to rebuke,
that's the word. It's necessary to realize
own inability in the beginning, the refusal
to think and in fact all own negative features.

It's necessary to feel ashamed and to swear that
you'll make a progress, that you'll try harder,
be faster, and to do your best to give a
performance that's worth it, and not to repeat
the previous failure.
