Hmmm...


It's hard to tell at the moment if it would be
good to mark you as a good player. You're certainly
a good hacker when you got here.

On the other hand - it's not a big problem to hack
the Bugs Escape. Once the "EXE" and "DAT" files
are decompressed, the way to hacking is free.

You know - you hackers have always been a rather
special group of computer users. What makes you
hack others' programs, computer networks and
who knows what else?

You surely have a reason for that, otherwise you
certainly wouldn't do that.

We personally have no quarrel with hackers, as
long as they have no quarrel with us. We can even
say that we admire you a bit. Not everyone, of
course, rather those good ones who do hacking
for fun or test their computer skills.

And since you've actually made it into this point
you deserve an award.

The music you should hear in the background can't
be found in the game. (If you've cracked the short
version of the Bugs Escape you won't hear it here,
either.) It was composed by our musician especially
for curious and smart people, who can't put up with
a mere standard way to finish a game, which means
it's designed just for you...
