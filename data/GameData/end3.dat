This is the end of the Bugs Escape. You broke
the twenty most difficult and tricky levels,
which means there's nothing more the Bugs
Escape can surprise you by.

Please accept our sincere congratulation, with
the touching tones of the victory melody...
(The last a few words apply only for owners
of sound cards.)


Thank you for the time you've spent with our
game, and keep in mind that although the Bugs
Escape doesn't seem so, we spent many sleepless
nights with it looking for nasty dynamic errors
for endless hours, or trying to implement new
enhancements that hadn't been planned.

Anyway, we think the effort was worth it. We
haven't created anyting exceptional, however,
we hope that the Bugs Escape could be
interesting for a small group of fans, who
are always happy to play it, or who share
a well done user level.

In the end, we'd like to thank everyone who
contributed or came up with an interesting
idea or just reported a severe bug.

You can see the list of the most important
contributors in the "Authors" section of
the help.

And that's it for today.
If we're attacked by
a treacherous creative libido
someday in the future,
we'll definitely commit
a game,
but that's
more or less
another
fairy tale...
